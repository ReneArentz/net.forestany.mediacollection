Version Highlights:

- Search field improvements:
  - Now supports the special characters `#`, `@`, and `&`.
  - Added special filter logic for "FiledUnder":
    - If only one character is entered, the app searches for this character as uppercase at the beginning of the column, or as a standalone uppercase letter followed by a space.
    - The same logic is now applied to the quick search feature in the toolbar.

- "Last seen" field:
  - Now uses a date picker for easier date selection.
  - Added new menu item for listing "last seen" elements.

- UI enhancements:
  - Added a new menu item for elements with no movie poster.
  - Added a loading screen when gathering the statistics summary.

- Synchronization improvements:
  - Fixed issues causing sync to take too long with large collections.
  - Sync is now faster by exchanging only a list of record summaries instead of full details.
  - Added improved and more detailed sync status messages.
  - Sync and import are now implemented as foreground services.

- Foreground service notifications:
  - The app now checks if notifications for foreground services are enabled and informs the user at startup if they are not.
