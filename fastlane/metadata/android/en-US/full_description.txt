This app helps you easily catalog and manage your personal blu-ray and dvd collection, including movies and TV series. Designed for simplicity and speed, it works completely offline with no accounts, ads, or tracking.

Built using a custom lightweight framework with minimal dependencies, this app is focused on performance and long-term stability. All data stays on your device â€” your collection is private and secure.

For advanced users, the app also offers an optional synchronization feature. To use this, you must host and administer your own server. Synchronization requires a REST web service that you create yourself or the official open-source server project (to be released soon). This ensures that all data remains entirely under your control, with no external services involved.

Ideal for collectors who want a fast, no-frills way to keep track of their media library while maintaining full ownership and privacy of their data.
